<p>This is a test for the open source rendering engine OpenWeb.</p>

<p>OpenWeb is, right now, in a very early stage of development. In a very crude way, it reads certain tags in an HTML file, but does so in a very sloppy way--a way in which I need to improve on in the future.</p>

<p>At this point, you may be wondering: How does a rendering engine work? For an incredibly basic overview, let's look at it this way: As the document is parsed, objects called "nodes" are created. These nodes contain all of the information necessary to display a certain part of a web page. These nodes are then taken and linked together as a linked list. This list is passed to the painter, which takes the information in the nodes and displays the web page.</p>

<p>So far, OpenWeb has been a great project. I'm excited to see where it develops.</p>
