Welcome to OpenWeb!

OpenWeb is a personal project of mine. It came out of the news that my personal favorite browser, Opera, is abandoning my personal favorite rendering engine, Presto. Because of this, I've decided to write my own HTML rendering engine to gain more insight into how these pieces of software work.

OpenWeb will be updated as I complete work. This could be a very short-lived project, or it could grow into a fully featured engine--only time will tell. If it does gain momentum, I'll probably package an interface as well and release a browser.

At the current moment, I've only written a small amount of code. I've spent a large amount of time reading through the WebKit code and documentation to get a feel for how rendering engines function. However, please note that I will not be taking any code from the WebKit project. This will be strictly my own work (unless, of course, you decide to contribute some code!).

This will be an interesting project. Let's see where it goes.
