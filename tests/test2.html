<p>This is another test file. It can be used to document the feature that allows for multiple documents to be opened from the same instance of WebWhirr.</p>
<p>To use this, either press Ctrl/Command-O, or click on the file menu and select the "Open" option. Select one of the test files included with WebWhirr--that is, <b>test.html</b>, <b>test2.html</b>, <b>test3.html</b>, or <b>test4.html</b>, or any other HTML files that may be on your computer.</p>

<!--As this is a comment, it will not be displayed by WebWhirr.-->
<hr>

<p>Eventually, WebWhirr will gain more features, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>the ability to connect to the internet</li>
<li>a fully featured, customizable interface</li>
</ul>

<p>For now, however, the focus is on building the rendering base that will be used in the browser.</p>
