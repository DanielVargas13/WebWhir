# Contributing Guide

I would be happy to accept help! Please see the Github Projects tab for various tasks that need work.

## Requirements

The most important requirement for a pull request is that it MUST include tests that provide a reasonable coverage of the changed code. See the [tests](tests/) directory for examples.

If you begin working on a feature, please open a comment on the corresponding project to let me know that you are doing so.

## Code Style

I generally try to adhere to an 80 character limit (with rare exceptions if absolutely necessary), and use underscored_variable_names, CapitalizedFileNames and CapitalizedClassNames.
