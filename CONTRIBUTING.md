# Contributing Guide

I would be happy to accept help! The [TODO list](TODOS.md) is generally organized in order of features that will be implemented sooner and should be easier to implement if you would like ideas on where to start.

## Requirements

The most important requirement for a pull request is that it MUST include tests that provide a reasonable coverage of the changed code.

If you begin working on a feature, please open a pull request or an issue letting me know that you are doing so.

## Code Style

I generally try to adhere to an 80 character limit (with rare exceptions if absolutely necessary), and use underscored_variable_names, CapitalizedFileNames and CapitalizedClassNames.
