This is a test for the open source rendering engine OpenWeb.

<p>OpenWeb is, right now, in a very early stage of development. In a very crude way, it reads the <p> tag in an HTML file, but does so in a very sloppy way--a way in which I need to improve on in the future..</p>

<p>At this point, you may be wondering: How does a rendering engine work? For an incredibly basic overview, let's look at it this way: As the document is parsed, objects called "nodes" are created. These nodes contain all of the information necessary to display a certain part of a web page. These nodes are then taken and linked together as a linked list. This list is passed to the painter, which takes the information in the nodes and displays the web page.</p>

<p>If you would like to build, test or modify OpenWeb, please be aware of some prerequisites. OpenWeb currently uses SFML for its graphics handling in addition to other libraries, including the "C String Toolkit Library" (which in turn relies on Boost). Both of these libraries are necessary to build OpenWeb. Finally, one last major current shortcoming is the implementation of fonts. As of 4/11/13, OpenWeb relies on a directory within the executable directory called "fonts" that contains the DejaVuSans True Type Font.</p>

<p>If nothing else, OpenWeb has taught me quite a bit about how to use external libraries. I spent a weekend fighting various graphics libraries, trying to force them to compile and link with OpenWeb properly--and, at the end of it, I have learned a significant amount about libraries, compilation, linking, and how UNIX works in general.</p>

<p>So far, OpenWeb has been a great project. I'm excited to see where it develops.</p>
