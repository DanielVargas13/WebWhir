Welcome to WebWhirr!

WebWhirr 0.2.0 is intended to be a simple HTML rendering engine. It is the beginning of what is intended to grow into a fully featured web suite.

When you start WebWhirr, a dialog will appear asking you to select a document to open. There are four test files included in this directory--test.html, test2.html, test3.html, and test4.html--but WebWhirr should be able to parse any simple HTML file, and should be able to paint any document that only uses the <p> and <b> tags.
Once you select a file, WebWhirr will paint the document you have selected. It is possible to open another file without closing WebWhirr--simply click on the File menu, and then select the Open option.

WebWhirr 0.2.0 is currently in the beta stage. This means that the current focus is on improving the existing codebase and fixing known bugs. For an idea of what will be worked on before the 0.2.0 final release, please consult the bug tracker on GitHub:

Please note that, even though the master branch has not been updated since September of 2013, development is still active! The painter has been completely rewritten, and its performance in the most recent builds is significantly better than that of the old painter. To see the progress that has been made, look at the painterRewrite branch.

Thank you for supporting the efforts of the WebWhirr team.
