Welcome to WebWhirr!

WebWhirr 0.2.0 is intended to be a simple HTML rendering engine. It is the beginning of what is intended to grow into a fully featured web suite.

When you start WebWhirr, a dialog will appear asking you to select a document to open. There are four test files included in this directory--test.html, test2.html, test3.html, and test4.html--but WebWhirr should be able to parse any simple HTML file, and should be able to paint any document that only uses the <p> and <b> tags.
Once you select a file, WebWhirr will paint the document you have selected. It is possible to open another file without closing WebWhirr--simply click on the File menu, and then select the Open option.

WebWhirr 0.2.0 is currently in the alpha stage. This means that the focus is on adding new features, and simply getting code down to work with. Then, once 0.2.0 enters the beta stage, this code will be revamped. The base of WebWhirr needs serious work (no one is more aware of this than myself), and I am eager to begin these maintenance tasks. There are still several features left to implement before this begins, however. For a comprehensive list, consult the roadmap on the GitHub wiki:
