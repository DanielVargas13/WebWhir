Welcome to WebWhirr!

WebWhirr 0.2.0 is intended to be a simple HTML rendering engine. It is the beginning of what is intended to grow into a fully featured web suite.

When you start WebWhirr, a dialog will appear asking you to select a document to open. There are four test files included in this directory--test.html, test2.html, test3.html, and test4.html--but WebWhirr should be able to parse any simple HTML file, and should be able to paint any document that only uses the <p> and <b> tags.
Once you select a file, WebWhirr will paint the document you have selected. It is possible to open another file without closing WebWhirr--simply click on the File menu, and then select the Open option.
