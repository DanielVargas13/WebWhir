Welcome to WebWhirr!

WebWhirr 0.3.0 is intended to be a simple HTML rendering engine. It is the beginning of what is intended to grow into a fully featured web suite.

WebWhirr 0.3.0 shares no code with versions 0.1.0 and 0.2.0. In May of 2015, I decided to start work again from scratch. While I think rewrites are in principle a poor idea, I believe that the 0.2.0 branch has stalled enough that it is time to start from a new beginning.
